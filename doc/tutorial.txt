1 Introduction
==============

  CTENV is a smart tool-set to dramatically simplify your daily tasks
  for clearcase view management. To streamline the daily tasks and
  minimize any burdens with clearcase, CTENV provides super intuitive
  command line interface. For now, CTENV is optimized to provide the
  best support for single stream repository.


2 Prerequisite
==============

  CTENV is actively tested on Linux box. However, CTENV is expected to
  work for other platforms, such as solaris, hpux, and aix. CTENV is a
  bash shell script. To use CTENV, please make sure that you are using
  bash. Below is the list of tools and their version requirement for
  CTENV.

  - clearcase 7.0.1 or higher
  - bash 3.2.25 or higher
  - patch 2.7.5 or higher
  - tar 1.15.1 or higher


3 How to install CTENV
======================

  To install CTENV in your system, simply copy whole <ctenv_dir> to
  anywhere you want and put a path to <ctenv_dir> in your
  $PATH. That's it.


4 How to configure CTENV
========================

  Below are four steps to configure CTENV

  1) source CTENV start-up script

     $ source <ctenv_dir>/ctenv_bashrc

  2) run ctenv to get a "default" setting

     $ ctenv

     When you first run CTENV, it tries to create a "default"
     configuration file under your ${HOME} directory. please say 'Y'

  3) configure CTENV

     $ vi ${HOME}/.ctenv/ctenvrc

     In ctenvrc, there are five parameters for you to set. Please read
     the comments and set proper values.

  4) re-run CTENV to make sure that the setup is complete

     $ ctenv


5 How to get on-line help
=========================

  on-line help shows all available options and/or common use cases

  $ ctenv # this shows options only
  $ ctenv -h # this shows options and most common use cases


6 How to get your own config specs
==================================

  By default, there are two config specs under <ctenv_dir>/cs. As
  their name says, they are templates that you can use to create your
  own. So, make a copy and edit it. Please note that a filename for
  config spec __should__ end with ".cs"


7 CTENV tutorial
================

  + list available config specs and all views

    $ ctenv -l

    your output would be as follows;

    CTENV[INFO|04/21 12:44]::VIEW: my config specs and views
    >> config specs (under <path_to_global_config_specs>)
            idx: name
              0: globalcs
              1: template.br
              2: template

    >> local config specs (under <path_to_local_config_specs>)
            idx: name
              3: mylocalcs

    CTENV[SUCCESS|04/21 12:44]::VIEW: listing complete

    Note: you wouldn't see "globalcs" and "mylocalcs" until you create
    them.

    In the output, you can see 'idx' and 'name' for config specs. you
    can use either 'idx' or 'name' to specify your config spec for
    ctenv.

  + create a new dynamic view, my_view, using config spec, globalcs

    $ ctenv -s globalcs -c my_view

    NOTE: when you specify config spec, you can use 'idx', 0, instead
    of 'name', globalcs

    $ ctenv -s 0 -c my_view # the same as above

  + create two dynamic views, my_view2, test w/ mylocalcs

    $ ctenv -c -s 3 my_view2 test

    NOTE: if you use '-C' instead of 'c', you will create a snapshot
    view

  + check the created views

    $ ctenv -l

    CTENV[INFO|04/21 12:44]::VIEW: my config specs and views
    >> config specs (under <path_to_global_config_specs>)
            idx: name
              0: globalcs
              1: template.br
              2: template

    >> local config specs (under <path_to_local_config_specs>)
            idx: name
              3: mylocalcs

    >> dynamic views
            idx: clearcase tag
              0: <your_id>_my_view_globalcs_<hostname>
              1: <your_id>_my_view2_mylocalcs_<hostname>
              2: <your_id>_test_mylocalcs_<hostname>

    CTENV[SUCCESS|04/21 12:44]::VIEW: listing complete

  + remove views w/ a given name in their tag name

    $ ctenv -r my_view

    NOTE: if you want to remove my_view only, use 'idx' 0.

  + check in all the changes in the view, test

    $ ctenv -ci test

    NOTE: this checks in the files that are checked out by
    'ctco'. how to check out files is explained in next section

  + sync all checked-out files in the view, test

    $ ctenv -sy test

    NOTE: this syncs the files checked out by 'ctco'.

  + export my changes in the view, test

    $ ctenv -e test

    NOTE: export is highly useful feature where you can keep can
    carry around your changes for back/forward port, code review, and
    so on

  + import <your_id>_test_mylocalcs_<hostname>.sh, into the other
    view, new_view

    $ ctenv -c -s mylocalcs new_view # create a new view first
    $ ctenv -i <your_id>_test_mylocalcs_<hostname>.sh new_view

    NOTE: this distills __changes__ stored in *.sh and applies them to
    a new_view. if there are conflicts while applying the __changes__,
    ctenv reports the conflicts and helps you to resolve them.

  + perform 2 way diff on all checked-out files against their
    predecessors in the view, test

    $ ctenv -d test
    $ ctcd test && ctenv -d . # cd into the view, test, do diffing for
    'test'

    NOTE: '.' has a special meaning only when your working directory,
    $PWD, is under a view. In this case, . means the view, test. As
    for the diffing tool, you can choose your own diffing tool by
    setting CTENV_UCONF_DIFF_TOOL properly in your
    ${HOME}/.ctenv/ctenvrc. you can put 'vimdiff', 'ediff', or
    whatever you like.

  + perform 2 way diff on given files against their predecessors in
    your view, test

    $ ctcd test && ctenv -d <file1> -d <dir1> -d <dir2>/<file2> .

  + compare given files between two views, test and new_view

    $ ctcd test && ctenv -D <file1> . new_view
    get the <file1> from two views and compare those two


7.1 Miscellaneous commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  In this section, all miscellaneous commands are explained. they are
  applied to files in a view rather than a view itself. you can check
  them in on-line help. (ctenv -h)

  + ctcd: cd into a given view, <view>

    $ ctcd new_view # cd into new_view

  + ctvcd: setview for <view>

    $ ctvcd new_view # setview for new_view

  + ctco: checkout given files

    $ ctco file1 dir1/file2 # checkout two files, file1 and dir1/file2

  + ctci: check in given files

    $ ctci file1 dir1/file2 # check in two files, file1 and dir1/file2

  + ctsync: sync given files

    $ ctsync file1 file2 # sync two checked-out files, file1 and file2

  + ctrvt: revert(uncheckout) given files

    $ ctrvt file1 file2 # revert(uncheckout) two checked-out files,
    file1 and file2

  + ctls: list all checked-out files under a given dir
    $ ctls # list all checked-out files under current dir
    $ ctls <dir> # list all checked-out files under <dir>
    $ ctls / # list all checked-out files in a current view

  + ctadd: add new files. note that dir w/ the files should be
    checkout first

    $ ctco .  # checkout a current dir
    $ ctadd file1 file2 # add two files under the dir

  + ctget: get files w/ given versions.

    $ ctget <file1>@@<version1> <file2>@@<version2>

    NOTE: for version, do 'cleartool desc <file1>'

  + ctblame: figure out when <regexp> was first introduced in a <file>
    $ ctblame <regexp> <file>


8 ediff for diffing and merging
===============================

  ediff is a bash shell script that implements advanced diffing and
  merging based on emacs. with ediff, we are able to do quick/easy
  diffing/merging on terminal.


8.1 basic key bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - jump to next diff
    "n"
  - jump to previous diff
    "p"
  - get online help for diffing
    "?"
  - switch among source & diff frames
    "ctrl-x ctrl-o"
  - exit
    "ctrl-x ctrl-c"


8.2 examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - diff two files (2-way diff)
    > ediff file1 file2

  - diff three files (3-way diff)
    > ediff file1 file2 file3
